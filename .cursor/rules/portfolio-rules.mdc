# Portfolio Project Rules

## Writing Style Guidelines

### Em Dash Usage
- **AVOID em dashes (—) throughout the codebase and content**
- **DO NOT replace em dashes with regular dashes (-) or slashes (/)**
- **INSTEAD: Restructure sentences using commas, conjunctions, or parentheses**

**Examples:**
```
❌ Bad: "This is important — it affects performance"
❌ Bad: "This is important - it affects performance" 
❌ Bad: "This is important / it affects performance"
✅ Good: "This is important because it affects performance"
✅ Good: "This is important, as it affects performance"
✅ Good: "This is important (it affects performance)"
```

### Sentence Restructuring Patterns
When eliminating em dashes, use these approaches:
- **Causal relationships:** Use "because," "since," "as"
- **Additional information:** Use commas or parentheses
- **Lists:** Use "like," "including," "such as"
- **Contrasts:** Use "but," "however," "while"
- **Sequential:** Use "then," "next," "after"
