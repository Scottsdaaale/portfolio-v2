        > <br />
        Nice little extension if you are working in HTML. Hosts a local server
        to view your HTML right inside of VSCode. Also updates in real time, so
        no refreshing.

          ></strong
        > <br />
        Same ol postman, but now in VSCode. Pretty nice to not need to switch
        between VSCode and Postman windows.

        Everybody knows this one right? A little tip though, you can configure

        Tabnine is a nifty tool that uses AI to autocomplete your code.
        Sometimes it's right, sometimes it's wrong. But it can be pretty

       Hello reader! Today I will be showing you how to create a star rating
       system using ReactJS. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a state
       with a value of a number for which star you clicked.
    </p>
 </div>
 <hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc" />
 <div class="flex-container">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
       <p>
          First, make a StarRating component, import, and render it in App. Then,
          we are going to do an install of <code>react-icons</code> so we can get
          the star. We can do that by opening the terminal in the correct
          directory and typing:
       </p>
       <code>npm install react-icons</code>
       <p>OR</p>
       <code>yarn add react-icons</code>
    </div>
 </div>
 <div class="flex-container">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
       <p>Then we will import the star by typing</p>
       <code>import { FaStar } from "react-icons/fa"</code>
       <p>in StarRating.</p>
    </div>
 </div>
 <hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc" />
 <div class="flex-container">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
       <p>
          After this, we are going to write this nifty little array map that will
          give us our 5 stars plus an index so we can give each star a value.
          Inside the map, we are going to return our label, a radio type input,
          and the FaStar component.
       </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-item">
       <img
          src="${starRating1}"
          alt="code photo 1"
          style="width: 100%;"
          />
    </div>
 </div>
 <hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc" />
 <div class="flex-container">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
       <p>
          Before we do anything else, let’s hide the radio buttons. In our CSS
          file, we can write this to do just that.
       </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-item">
       <img
          src="${starRating2}"
          alt="code photo 2"
          style="width: 100%;"
          />
    </div>
 </div>
 <hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc" />
 <div class="flex-container">
    <div style="margin: 1px; flex: 1;">
       <p>Now we are going to add an index value for each star. We are also going to add one to each index so that they don’t start with zero. Then we will add this ratingValue to the value of the input.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-item">
       <img
          src="${starRating3}"
          alt="code photo 3"
          style="width: 100%;"
          />
    </div>
 </div>
 <hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc" />
 <div class="flex-container">
    <div style="margin: 1px; flex: 1;">
       <p>Now we want to save the value of the input in state, so that we can persist it.
          So we need to import useState, make a new state and set it to null, then make an onClick in the input that will save the ratingValue to state every time you click on a star.
       </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-item">
       <img
          src="${starRating4}"
          alt="code photo 4"
          style="width: 100%;"
          />
    </div>
 </div>
 <hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc" />
 <div class="flex-container">
    <div style="flex: 1;">
       <p>
          Congrats! You have a functioning star rating! Now let’s make it a little
          bit prettier. With just a small ternary, we can make it so when we click
          on a star, it will light up and all the stars before it. React-icons can
          take in a color prop. So we can add that under <code>FaStar</code>. Then
          we will start our ternary. This code will take in the star we clicked’s
          index, and anything less than or equal to it will be gold, all other
          indices will be grey.
       </p>
    </div>
    <div class="flex-item">
       <img
          src="${starRating5}"
          alt="code photo 5"
          style="width: 100%;"
          />
    </div>
 </div>
 <hr style="border: 1px solid #ccc" />
 <div style="padding-bottom: 60px">
    <p>
       There you have it! A star rating component that will give you the value
       of the star clicked and save it to state to do with as you please. In a
       recent project, I used this to get an average rating and display it
       under videos. I hope this is helpful to someone!

    <p>
  At the time of writing this, I've been studying web development for almost 3
  years. There is a lot to learn when it comes to this career path, and it's
  been quite the battle just to keep myself learning as much as possible.
</p>
<p>
  I struggled for a long time with what I wanted to do as a career, and I tried
  many different things. I think a big reason for that is because when I don't
  like something it's very hard for me to keep focused on it, or really, to even
  want to do it at all. But I think I found something in programming that I
  didn't expect when I began studying.
</p>
<p>
  I actually really enjoy it.
  <br />
  <br />
  And if I'm honest, I don't really think I thought I would when I started.
</p>
<p>
  If you told me 5 years ago that I would be doing this right now, I wouldn't
  have believed it. I wouldn't have thought I was that type of guy because
  programming is for smart people, and I am dumb.
</p>
<p>
  Well I've been learning a lot about myself through this coding journey, and it
  turns out I'm actually NOT dumb! I just need to be ENGAGED.
</p>
<p>
  This journey has reshaped my understanding of my capabilities and strengths.
  It's not about innate intelligence but rather about finding genuine interest
  and engagement in what I do.
</p>
<p>
  I still struggle with losing focus constantly. Especially when I'm faced with
  an issue that I'm having trouble getting around. But I am able to hyper focus
  more often and end up grinding on projects for hours.
</p>
<p>
  I've been lucky enough to land some freelance gigs doing this work. It's been
  very rewarding! I don't struggle with hating work like I have at other jobs.
  Because of that I am able to focus and have tons of motivation.
</p>
<p>
  To wrap this up, here a few things I would recommend to people with ADHD who
  want to get into programming:
</p>

<br />

<p>Get good sleep-</p>

<p>
  There are tons of sleep tracking apps too that can track sleeping habits and
  help you correct them
</p>

<br />
<p>Follow a routine-</p>

<br />
<p>
  I recommend using a to-do list app. There are many out there, but I've been
  using
  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH5R558?ocid=pdpshare"
    >Todoist</a
  >
  because it works on Apple devices and Windows. Everyday I write out what I
  need to do. Doing something as simple as that really helps me hone in on what
  I need to get done that day.
</p>

<br />
<p>Use timers-</p>

<br />
<p>
  Timers are great for time management! I can figure out how much time I want to
  deticate to that particular task and set a timer for it. I've got a Stream
  Deck, which allows you to setup timers with the touch of a button.
</p>

<br />
<p>Take breaks when you feel overwhelmed</p>

<br />
<p>
  It's easy to get frustrated by a problem. Taking a short break is a good way
  to help yourself relax for a second and get a clear head. A lot of the time
  I'll come back and find a fix pretty soon after.
</p>

<br />

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
