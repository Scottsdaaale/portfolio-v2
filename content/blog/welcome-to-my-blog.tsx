        I finally got around to building this thing. I&apos;ve been meaning to start writing 
        for a while now, so here we are.
      </p>

      <h3>What I&apos;ll Write About</h3>
      
      <p>
        Mostly whatever I&apos;m thinking about or working on. Sometimes that&apos;s development 
        stuff, other times it might be completely unrelated.
      </p>

      <p>I have a lot of interests:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Development</strong> - Vibe coding!</li>
        
        <li><strong>Music</strong> - I listen to a lot of heavy music (checkout my heavy playlist <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6DjzkWAzw9eR607gJEObFc?si=54a6ba4c7f1f4416">Spotify</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Video games</strong> - GC in Rocket League! (....many seasons ago)</li>
        <li><strong>Plants</strong> - I have many!</li>
        <li><strong>Skiing</strong> - I love skiing! I&apos;m a season pass holder at Berkshire East.</li>
        <li><strong>Hiking/Camping</strong> - I spend most weekends on trails when the weather&apos;s decent</li>
        <li className="text-pretty"><strong>Random stuff</strong> - I obsess over a lot of things (ADHD). Furniture, canoeing, travel, tattoos, amusement parks, camping gear, whiskey.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      
      <p>
        I&apos;m a full-stack developer working in Human Services/eLearning. I build all sorts of software. Interal tools, and marketing sites mostly. It&apos;s actually 
        pretty interesting work, to me at least.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I&apos;m usually hiking somewhere, practicing guitar, or 
        tending to my small collection of plants that may or may not survive the winter.
      </p>

      <h3>Quick Note on Content</h3>
      
      <p>
        Some (probably most) posts here will be AI-generated for SEO purposes: technical tutorials, guides, tech stuff,
        that kind of thing. Gotta help people find this site somehow. But the personal stuff, 
        stories, and random thoughts are all me.
      </p>

      <p>
        That&apos;s about it. Thanks for stopping by.
