      <h2>My Experience Programming with ADHD</h2>
      
      <p>
        I got diagnosed with ADHD about a year into my programming career, and honestly, 
        it explained a lot. The constant context switching, the ability to hyperfocus for hours 
        on a problem, the way my brain jumps between different solutions—it all suddenly made sense.
      </p>

      <h3>The Hyperfocus Superpower (And Curse)</h3>
      
      <p>
        When I&apos;m in the zone, I can code for 8-10 hours straight and forget to eat. 
        I&apos;ll solve complex problems, refactor entire codebases, and feel like I&apos;m 
        channeling pure productivity. It&apos;s honestly amazing when it happens.
      </p>

      <p>
        But hyperfocus is a double-edged sword:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Time blindness</strong> - I&apos;ll think I&apos;ve been coding for an hour when it&apos;s been five</li>
        <li><strong>Tunnel vision</strong> - I&apos;ll over-engineer a simple feature because it&apos;s interesting</li>
        <li><strong>Burnout risk</strong> - Going full throttle isn&apos;t sustainable</li>
        <li><strong>Missing the forest for the trees</strong> - Getting stuck on implementation details while losing sight of the bigger picture</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Dopamine-Driven Development Cycle</h3>
      
      <p>
        My ADHD brain is basically a dopamine-seeking machine, and programming can be 
        perfect for this. Every solved bug, every feature that works, every successful 
        deploy is a little hit of satisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this also means:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>I gravitate toward new, shiny tech</strong> because it&apos;s stimulating</li>
        <li><strong>Debugging can be torture</strong> when the dopamine hits stop coming</li>
        <li><strong>I need variety</strong> - doing the same type of work for weeks kills my motivation</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation feels like punishment</strong> (sorry to my future self)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Working Memory Issues</h3>
      
      <p>
        ADHD messes with working memory, which is kind of important when you&apos;re 
        trying to hold complex system architecture in your head while writing code.
      </p>

      <h4>What This Looks Like:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Forgetting what I was working on if I get interrupted</li>
        <li>Losing track of nested function calls or complex data flows</li>
        <li>Having to re-read my own code multiple times to understand it</li>
        <li>Struggling to context switch between different parts of a large codebase</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>My Workarounds:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Obsessive commenting</strong> - I comment everything, even obvious stuff</li>
        <li><strong>TODO comments everywhere</strong> - If I have a thought, it goes in a comment immediately</li>
        <li><strong>Small, focused functions</strong> - Easier to understand and test</li>
        <li><strong>Documentation-driven development</strong> - Writing docs first helps me think through problems</li>
        <li><strong>Git commits with detailed messages</strong> - My commit history is basically a diary</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Rejection Sensitivity Thing</h3>
      
      <p>
        ADHD often comes with rejection sensitive dysphoria (RSD), which makes criticism 
        feel way more intense than it should. Code reviews can be brutal for this.
      </p>

      <p>
        I&apos;ve learned to:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ask for specific feedback</strong> rather than general reviews</li>
        <li><strong>Frame feedback as learning opportunities</strong> (easier said than done)</li>
        <li><strong>Take breaks between writing code and reviewing it</strong> to get some emotional distance</li>
        <li><strong>Remember that code critique isn&apos;t personal critique</strong> (still working on this one)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Tools That Actually Help</h3>
      
      <p>
        I&apos;ve tried a million productivity systems, but here&apos;s what actually works for my ADHD brain:
      </p>

      <h4>Development Tools:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI assistants (Cursor, GitHub Copilot)</strong> - Help with context switching and reduce cognitive load</li>
        <li><strong>Really good syntax highlighting and IntelliSense</strong> - Visual cues help my brain stay on track</li>
        <li><strong>Automated formatting (Prettier)</strong> - One less thing to think about</li>
        <li><strong>Hot reload/live preview</strong> - Instant feedback feeds the dopamine loop</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Organization:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pomodoro technique</strong> - Forces breaks and prevents hyperfocus burnout</li>
        <li><strong>Time-blocking</strong> - Dedicated time for deep work vs. meetings</li>
        <li><strong>Task breakdown</strong> - Big features become many small, achievable tasks</li>
        <li><strong>Daily standups</strong> - External accountability and structure</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Unexpected Advantages</h3>
      
      <p>
        ADHD isn&apos;t just challenges—it comes with some genuine superpowers for programming:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pattern recognition</strong> - I spot code smells and architectural issues quickly</li>
        <li><strong>Creative problem-solving</strong> - My brain makes weird connections that sometimes lead to elegant solutions</li>
        <li><strong>Hyperfocus debugging</strong> - I can chase down the most obscure bugs with relentless determination</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptability</strong> - I actually thrive in the constant change of tech</li>
        <li><strong>Big picture thinking</strong> - I naturally see how different systems connect</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What I Wish I&apos;d Known Earlier</h3>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Your brain is different, not broken</strong> - Stop trying to force neurotypical productivity methods</li>
        <li><strong>Structure is freedom</strong> - Routines and systems actually enable creativity</li>
        <li><strong>It&apos;s okay to need more breaks</strong> - Mental fatigue is real</li>
        <li><strong>Play to your strengths</strong> - Find roles that utilize hyperfocus and creativity</li>
        <li><strong>Medication can be life-changing</strong> - Don&apos;t write it off without trying</li>
        <li><strong>You&apos;re not alone</strong> - A lot of developers have ADHD, we just don&apos;t talk about it enough</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>To Other ADHD Developers</h3>
      
      <p>
        If you&apos;re reading this and thinking "holy shit, that&apos;s me," you&apos;re not broken. 
        Programming can actually be an amazing career for ADHD brains when you learn to work 
        with your neurodivergence instead of against it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Find your rhythm, use tools that help, and don&apos;t be afraid to advocate for what you need. 
        The tech industry is slowly getting better at understanding neurodiversity, but you might 
        need to educate your team about how your brain works.
      </p>

      <p>
        And remember: some of the most innovative developers I know have ADHD. Our brains are 
        wired for pattern recognition, creative problem-solving, and thinking outside the box. 
        Those aren&apos;t bugs—they&apos;re features.
      </p>

      <p><em>Now excuse me while I go hyperfocus on refactoring this entire codebase...</em></p>
